# Game flow foundation

## Stable bootstrap

`godot/scenes/main.tscn` is the permanent `run/main_scene`. It contains only a
`ScreenHost` and binds that host to the `FlowCoordinator` autoload. The
coordinator swaps the host's child; it never changes the Godot scene tree's
current scene.

Feature scenes must not change `run/main_scene`, call
`change_scene_to_file()`, or name one another's scene paths. All gameplay
navigation goes through `FlowCoordinator`.

`FlowCoordinator` owns the persistent `RunStateNode`. Replacing a screen does
not recreate that node, so contract state survives every screen transition.
Player money and upgrades remain a separate concern and use the
`PlayerStateGlobal` autoload rather than being added to run state.

## Lifecycle

The plain Rust model in `cyber_heist/src/run_state.rs` enforces these states:

- `hub`: no active encounter.
- `encounter_active`: exactly one active encounter with an ID and type.
- `caught`: retains that active encounter so caught UI and penalty code can
  inspect it. Finishing the caught flow returns to the hub and clears it.

Rejected transitions do not mutate run state. The Godot adapter returns
`{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` for a rejection and `{"ok": true}` for
success. `FlowCoordinator.run_snapshot()` returns:

```gdscript
{
    "phase": "hub", # or "encounter_active" / "caught"
    "active_encounter": null, # or {"id": String, "type": String}
}
```

Supported lifecycle encounter types are `combat`, `event`, `shop`, and
`elite`. A type also needs a coordinator-owned scene registration before it
can be entered; only `combat` is registered today.

## Scene-facing API

```gdscript
FlowCoordinator.start_encounter(encounter_id: String, encounter_type: String)
FlowCoordinator.complete_active_encounter()
FlowCoordinator.report_caught()
FlowCoordinator.finish_caught()
FlowCoordinator.run_snapshot()
```

Every transition method returns a result dictionary. A destination is checked
and instantiated before lifecycle state changes, then the current screen is
replaced only after the Rust transition succeeds.

A future encounter-selection screen starts a selected encounter without
navigating directly:

```gdscript
var result := FlowCoordinator.start_encounter(encounter.id, encounter.type)
```

A losing encounter reports its outcome in the same way:

```gdscript
var result := FlowCoordinator.report_caught()
```

`caught_screen.tscn` is integrated with the coordinator. Its Continue button
finishes the caught lifecycle through:

```gdscript
FlowCoordinator.finish_caught()
```

The caught screen applies its separate `PlayerStateGlobal` penalty once, while
the coordinator continues to own navigation. Both autoloads remain registered,
and the Rust crate registers the caught-penalty and game-flow classes together.
